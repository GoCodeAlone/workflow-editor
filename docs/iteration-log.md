## Fixed Issues

### 2026-03-18 — Editor-Engine Contract Enforcement
- **CRITICAL / drift**: Editor had hardcoded COERCION_RULES (63 lines) that could drift from engine — FIXED: now reads from generated engine-schemas.json
- **CRITICAL / serialization**: Editor wrote `ui_position` into YAML output, modifying configs on open — FIXED: stripped from serialization, layout stored in `.workflow-editor.json` sidecar
- **HIGH / drift**: `mergeSchemas()` preserved static ioSignature over engine schemas — FIXED: engine schemas now take priority
- **HIGH / connections**: Connection rules were static in editor, not derived from engine — FIXED: coercion rules + IO signatures loaded from engine export
- **MEDIUM / ide**: Both IDE plugin sync workflows were manually disabled since March 13 — FIXED: re-enabled, both synced to v0.3.4800

## Learnings

- The engine's `ModuleSchemaRegistry` already has Inputs/Outputs/MaxIncoming/MaxOutgoing — the editor just wasn't using them
- `wfctl editor-schemas` exports everything the editor needs in one JSON file
- Golden file tests in the engine catch schema changes before they break the editor
- Contract tests with ajv validate round-trip output against the engine's JSON schema
- The sync-schema CI workflow is the gatekeeper — if contract tests fail, no publish, no dispatch to IDE plugins
